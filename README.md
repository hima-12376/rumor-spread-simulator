Project Description
This project is an AI-powered misinformation monitoring dashboard that analyzes rumors using natural language processing, verifies claims through online news corroboration, detects AI-generated video content, and simulates rumor spread across a social network.

Problem statement
Misinformation and fake news spread rapidly across digital platforms, often amplified by emotionally charged language and synthetic media such as deepfake videos. This leads to public panic, misinformation campaigns, and societal disruption.

The Solution
Our system integrates:
Transformer-based linguistic analysis
Web-based news verification
Hybrid deepfake video detection
Social contagion-based rumor spread simulation

to evaluate credibility and simulate the diffusion of misinformation across a social network.
